# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform wheels, pipenv may install dependencies in a virtualenv located in
#   the project root (as of 2018-01-26, see discussion in pypa/pipenv#984).
#   Therefore, do not include the virtualenv content in the repository.
